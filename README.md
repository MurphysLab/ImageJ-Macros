A small miscellany of macro code files for ImageJ, for various tasks.

Some are simply demo files.

* Find_All_Pixel_Groups.ijm *Finds all groups of connected pixels in a binary image; demonstrates two methods.*

* Line_to_Scalebar_Equal_Ticks.jnm *Divides a line into N equal parts with N-1 ticks.*

* Draw_Spheres_and_Merge_Stacks.ijm *Creates two stacks with binary spheres, then overlays them in RGB colour*

* Point-to-Line Distance Distribution.ijm *Draws a scatterplot showing pixel values and distances relative to a line selection.*



Output scatter plot, with distance on the horizontal axis and value on the vertical axis (decreasing downward).
